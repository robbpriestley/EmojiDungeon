### Overview

**EmojiDungeon** is a browser-based video game that builds on my [MazeGenerator](https://github.com/robbpriestley/MazeGenerator) project, and serves to showcase my front-end scripting ability. Using the same maze-generaton algorithm as MazeGenerator, EmojiDungeon then adds an entire interactive layer built using **TypeScript**. The gameplay code, including a rudimentary AI, is entirely implemented using almost 1,500 lines of TypeScript (see **script.ts**). Please click the link above to see the demo and click the **How to Play** button for instructions.
