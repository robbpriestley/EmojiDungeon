	<p>Welcome! <strong>Emoji Dungeon</strong> is a simple turn-based strategy game that runs in your web browser. You are placed inside a randomly-determined dungeon filled with goblins and treasure. Your goal is to get the highest score possible as you explore the dungeon. Every single dungeon level you explore is unique.</p>
	<p><span class="sprite infoplayer"></span>This is you. You can move about the dungeon one turn at a time by pressing the arrow keys on your keyboard. If you don't have a keyboard, you can press the direction arrows on the screen.</p>
	<p><span class="sprite infogem"></span>This is a gem. Gems are treasure. You score one point for every gem you collect as you move through the dungeon.</p>
	<p><span class="sprite infogoblin"></span>This is a goblin. Goblins are your enemies. They will always seek to attack you and will follow the fastest path through the dungeon to get to you. But, they cannot pass through doors, and they cannot pass over one another. Every time you make a move, each goblin is free to make a move as well.</p>
	<p><span class="sprite infoheart"></span>This is a heart. Hearts represent your life force. You start with three hearts. If a goblin attacks you and you don't have a sword, you will lose a heart. Your game is over if you drop to zero hearts. Hearts can be found and collected in the dungeon. Goblins cannot collect hearts, and are destroyed if they take one of your hearts.</p>
	<p><span class="sprite infokey"></span>This is a key. Keys can be used to open doors. Keys can be found and collected in the dungeon. Goblins cannot collect keys.</p>
	<p><span class="sprite infodoor"></span>&nbsp;This is a door. Doors are always locked. Goblins cannot pass through a door, but you can if you have a key. When you unlock a door, the key is consumed and cannot be used again.</p>
	<p><span class="sprite infosword"></span>This is a sword. If you encounter a goblin and you have a sword, you destroy the goblin and score ten points, but the sword is consumed and cannot be used again. Swords can be found and collected in the dungeon. Goblins cannot collect swords.</p>
	<p><span class="sprite infostairsdown"></span>&nbsp;These are stairs going down. You can explore an unlimited number of dungeon levels by descending stairs. Every level has exactly one set of stairs going down.</p>
	<p><span class="sprite infostairsup"></span>&nbsp;These are stairs going up. If you want to, you can also return to dungeon levels you've already been to by ascending stairs. Every level has exactly one set of stairs going up.</p>
